# Kubernetes-POC

## About
This is a simple proof of concept for setting up a load-balanced and secure kubernetes-cluster for a frontend and backend.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python
- Node
- Docker
- Kubectl

### Production

First, clone the directory.

Make sure Docker Desktop is running and you have Kubernetes enabled.

Open a commandline at the directory's location, and create an image from the Dockerfile in the respective folders.

```commandline
cd ./client
docker build -t kpoc-client:latest .
cd ../server
docker build -t kpoc-server:latest .
cd ..
```

Make sure it is using the Docker for Desktop context by running the following:
```commandline
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

Use kubectl to send the YAML file to Kubernetes by running the following command:
```commandline
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Now we should see the application is deployed at http://localhost:83

#### Clean-up

To terminate the kubernetes cluster run:
```commandline
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```

To remove the image run:
```commandline
docker rmi kpoc-client
docker rmi kpoc-server
```

### Development

To start the client run the following in the respective directory:
```commandline
ng serve
```

The client should be deployed on http://localhost:4200

To start the server run:
```commandline
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server is now deployed on http://localhost:8000

## Research
Before creating this implementation I had to do some research on Kubernetes. After that I needed to research this particular implementation. To do this research properly, I need to come up with some questions on the topics, so that I find the answers I need. For this research I will be using the DOT framework.

The research I did during the project can be found [here](../master/kubernetes&20research.pdf).
